This repository holds both the final version of my `3D Scene Project` as well
as my `Design Decisions` document detailing the reason for my design choices. I
apporached this project modularly; dividing it into smaller parts and working
on those small peices incrementally. I developed this program with reusable
functions for texture integration, transformation, and rendering methods to
construct the scene. The project has introduced me to more advanced technical
abilities including working with OpenGL, texturing, creating materials, adding
lighting to the scene, and reconstructing a real scene into a virtual
representation. Continuing to hone these skills could lead to expertise in
areas such as games design, computer generated graphics, and virtual
simulations.
